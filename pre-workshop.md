## UVic Guidelines for Using Generative AI in Research
As a researcher it is very important that you carefully review UVic's guidelines for using [*Generative AI in research*](https://www.uvic.ca/research-innovation/strategic-initiatives/gen-ai-in-research/index.php){:target="_blank"}, which are based on Canada's [Tri-agency Artificial Intelligence guidelines](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/use-generative-artificial-intelligence-development-and-review-research-proposals/guidance-use-artificial-intelligence-development-and-review-research-grant-proposals){:target="_blank"}.

## Pre-Workshop Videos & Activities
This workshop is primarily hands-on practice with Microsoft 365 and Whisper transcription services to learn to use key features of the software.

**Please Note: If you are a UVic staff or faculty member, you will not be able to use the Whisper.ai transcription software unless your faculty systems support person installs it for you.** Here is a link to the [Windows Software](https://download.gowhisper.io/){:target="_blank"} & the [Mac Software](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper){:target="_blank"}. You will be able to use the Microsoft 365 transcription service without any problems.

To participate fully, please do the following **before the workshop**:

## Transcription Services: UVic Research Ethics Considerations

### Not Cloud Based:
**Whisper.ai**: We do not need to disclose the use of Whisper.ai, as all data is processed locally on the researcher’s computer (similar to not needing to disclose the use of MS Word running on a laptop).

### Cloud-Based but Hosted in Canada & UVic Licensed:
**Office 365 Transcription**: We must disclose the use of the MS Office 365 transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, but if we’re using the UVic-licensed version of MS Office 365 then there is no need for a US Freedom Act disclosure as UVic pays to have our version of MS Office 365 hosted in Canada.

### Cloud-Based and Hosted in the USA:
**Otter.ai**: We must disclose the use of the Otter.ai transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as Otter.ai data is processed and stored in the USA (at least in part).

**Zoom Transcription**: We must disclose the use of Zoom for interviews on our Research Ethics applications and on the participant consent form. The UVic-licensed version of Zoom routes all the audio and video through Canadian servers, so if you don’t use the Zoom transcription service then there is no need to include a US Freedom Act disclosure. If you use the Zoom transcription service, you must disclose its use on your Research Ethics application and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as Zoom transcription data is processed and stored in the USA (at least in part).

**YouTube**: We must disclose the use of YouTube for transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as YouTube data is processed and stored in the USA.
