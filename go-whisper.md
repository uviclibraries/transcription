# GoWhisper Transcription Activity for Windows

1. If you are using a Windows computer, go to the [GoWhisper website](https://download.gowhisper.io/){:target="_blank"}, and then download the **Windows version** of GoWhisper. Please note the location where your web browser is saving the GoWhisper install file (usually your "Downloads", "Documents", or "Desktop" folder).
2. Go to the folder where the GoWhisper install file was saved, and then double-click on it and follow the installation directions.
3. Open the GoWhisper program. When the program is open, click on the model selector to the left of the cog icon located in the top right of the window.
4. Select the **Base** model offers a good balance of speed accuracy.<br>

5. Next, click **Upload your file here** icon, and then select an audio file to transcribe. If you donâ€™t have an MP3 audio file to transcribe, [download this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sncU_2N5JenM2TC5DJXZgHPdeZAwxGbi/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. This file is snippet of a podcast rather than the full episode (to reduce processing time for this workshop).<br>
