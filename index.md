# Transcription with Whisper.ai and Microsoft 365

- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 30-40 min

## Why use transcription services?

Automated transcription services can help save time in qualitative research. While there are many options available, [Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57), [Whisper Transciption](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whisper-transcription/id1668083311?mt=12), and [Zoom](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0064927) are services that are free for UVic students and faculty. When choosing transciption services to use, one should also take into account the pros, cons, and research ethics considerations that are specific to each service.

## Transcription Services: UVic Research Ethics Considerations

**Not Cloud Based:**

Whisper.ai: We do not need to disclose the use of Whisper.ai, as all data is processed locally on the researcher’s computer (similar to not needing to disclose the use of MS Word running on a laptop).

**Cloud-Based but Hosted in Canada & UVic Licensed:**

Office 365 Transcription: We must disclose the use of the MS Office 365 transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, but if we’re using the UVic-licensed version of MS Office 365 then there is no need for a US Freedom Act disclosure as UVic pays to have our version of MS Office 365 hosted in Canada.

**Cloud-Based and Hosted in the USA:**

Otter.ai: We must disclose the use of the Otter.ai transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as Otter.ai data is processed and stored in the USA (at least in part).

Zoom Transcription: We must disclose the use of Zoom for interviews on our Research Ethics applications and on the participant consent form. The UVic-licensed version of Zoom routes all the audio and video through Canadian servers, so if you don’t use the Zoom transcription service then there is no need to include a US Freedom Act disclosure. If you use the Zoom transcription service, you must disclose its use on your Research Ethics application and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as Zoom transcription data is processed and stored in the USA (at least in part).

YouTube: We must disclose the use of YouTube for transcription on our Research Ethics applications, and participant consent form, and include a US Freedom Act disclosure as YouTube data is processed and stored in the USA.
